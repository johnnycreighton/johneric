    <string name="main_about_us_message">The goal with this app is to provide
        its users with another means of measuring electricity a little out of the norm
        but hopefully easier to intuitively adopt. We felt that if we can give users
        an idea of the average physical activity they would have to perform to generate the same
        power as our everyday appliances, we might give them a shock. Pun intended..!
        With the end goal making them more aware and conscious of power they might be wasting.
        We have created a quiz to see if peoples judgement of power usage is as accurate as
        they might think and if not hopefully our app can help align the two. With more time
        we would like to add more features and strengthen current ones. We have other plans
        that are not practical within the time frame. </string>
